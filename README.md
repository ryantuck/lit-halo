LIT Halo
===========

## Overview

Source code for the LIT Halo - the first high quality rave gear designed specifically for the EDM community. 

[Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/litlitlit/halo-rave-gear-revolutionized) was ran from 9 May - 9 June 2014. We raised $17k, falling short of the amount necessary to manufacture.

This code can be run on most Arduinos and an LED strip if relevant pins are adjusted and custom shift register writing is replaced with or mapped to LED strip library. 

## Structure

This repo is an object-oriented C++ library designed to run on the Arduino platform. 

It contains hardware objects to represent the chips on the Halo's PCB, as well as a system for easily managing and creating LED patterns (called `foos`).
